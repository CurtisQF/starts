## ST Arts

### Overview

ST Arts will be a centralized location for arts companies to advertise themselves and their events and for the general public to search for these companies and their events. The public user will be able to search and filter the events based on the type of performance and other criteria and also view a calendar of events.

Rollout 2: Companies could expand to include performing arts academies and listings of their classes. Rollout 3: Companies could post jobs, auditions, and other Craigslist-type posts on a virtual callboard for people in the theatre community.
